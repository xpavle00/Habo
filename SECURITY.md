## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in Habo:

1. Do **not** open a public issue.  
2. Instead, please use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory) feature by clicking:  
   - Go to the repository’s **Security tab**  
   - Click **"Report a vulnerability"**  
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fix (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and work with you to release a fix as quickly as possible.

## 🤝 Disclosure Policy
- We will confirm the issue, develop a fix, and release an update before publicly disclosing the vulnerability.  
- Credit will be given to security researchers who responsibly report issues (unless anonymity is requested).

## 🙏 Thanks
We appreciate the work of the security community in helping keep Habo safe for everyone.
