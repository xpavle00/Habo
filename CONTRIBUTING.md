# Contributing to Habo  

We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing to **Habo**! 🎉  
Our goal is to make the contribution process clear, productive, and respectful for everyone.  

Whether you’re reporting a bug, suggesting an enhancement, or submitting a pull request (PR), please follow these guidelines.

## 📝 How to Contribute  

### 1. Start with an Issue  
- **Before writing any code**, please [create an issue](https://github.com/xpavle00/Habo/issues/new) to:  
  - Report a bug  
  - Request a new feature  
  - Propose an improvement  

This gives the community and maintainers a chance to discuss the change before work begins.  

### 2. Fork & Branch  
- Fork the repo and create a new branch from `main`.  
  - Use a descriptive branch name, e.g. `fix/login-bug` or `feature/dark-mode`.  

### 3. Keep Pull Requests Focused  
- Each PR should relate **only to the issue or feature it addresses**.  
- Do **not** include unrelated changes such as formatting, whitespace cleanup, or refactors.  
- If you want to make formatting or refactoring changes, open a separate PR for that.  

### 4. Development Checklist  
Before submitting a PR, please ensure:  
- ✅ The change is tested and works on **Android and iOS**.  
- ✅ Code passes linting and formatting checks.  
- ✅ Any new functionality has appropriate tests (if applicable).  
- ✅ Commit messages are clear and descriptive.
