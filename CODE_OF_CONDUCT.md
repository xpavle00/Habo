# Habo Code of Conduct

We expect all members, contributors, and leaders in the Habo community—especially those working with Flutter—to act professionally, respectfully, and in a way that maintains the safety and dignity of all.

- Respect people, including their identities, culture, and their work.  
- Be kind, courteous, and welcoming.  
- Listen to others; consider and acknowledge their points before responding.  
- Be inclusive and avoid assumptions.

## What’s not okay

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassing or discriminatory behavior (language, tone, slurs).  
- Public or private harassment.  
- Publishing others’ personal/private information without consent.  
- Unwelcome sexual attention.  
- Trolling, insults, derogatory or demeaning comments or conduct.

## Conflict resolution

- If you disagree or have a concern, first try to discuss respectfully with the person(s) involved.  
- If that doesn’t resolve things, reach out to a project maintainer or lead.  
- We want disagreements to be constructive, not personal.
